<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I'm a software engineer at Google NYC. Before joining Google, I worked as
  financial software developer in the data feeds team at Bloomberg LP, also in NYC.

<p>I graduated in May 2011 with a M.S. degree in Computer Science at University
  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a B.S. degree also in Computer Science from
  UFRGS, in Brazil.
