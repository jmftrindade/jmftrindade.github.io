			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
                        <p>I'm a software engineer at Google NYC. Before joining Google, I worked as financial software developer in the data feeds team at Bloomberg LP, also in NYC.     I graduated in May 2011 with a MS degree in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before going to Urbana-Champaign, I received a Bachelor of Science degree also in computer science from UFRGS, in Brazil.</p>
